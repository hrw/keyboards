# Alicja

First was TGR Alice, then [@FateNozomi](https://github.com/FateNozomi) created [Arisu](https://github.com/FateNozomi/arisu-pcb).
Next was [@floookay](https://github.com/floookay) with his [Adelheid](https://github.com/floookay/adelheid).

Then I took his keyboard and modified into what I call Alicja (Alice in Polish).


## First prototype

As simple as possible:
- 3d printed switch plate (two pieces mounted with each other)
- no PCB, no case
- UltimatePico as controller
- Redragon brown switches
- mix of keycaps from Aliexpress and random keyboards
- no stabilizers
